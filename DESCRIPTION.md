# capytrace.nvim

**capytrace.nvim** is a modern, lightweight Neovim plugin designed to automatically capture, organize, and export your debugging journey in real time. It seamlessly records terminal commands, file edits, code navigation, and more, providing a structured timeline of your development and debugging sessions. Built with a focus on performance, extensibility, and developer experience, capytrace.nvim empowers you to trace back your steps, annotate your intent, and resume your work contextually‚Äîeven after switching tasks or machines.

## Key Features

- **Context-Aware Debug Logging**: Automatically logs terminal commands, file modifications, and Git diffs during debugging sessions.
- **Live Debug Session Recorder**: Tracks file edits, cursor movements, LSP diagnostics, and breakpoints as you work.
- **Structured Session Timeline**: Exports each session as a detailed Markdown or JSON file, complete with timestamps and event tags.
- **User Annotations**: Add notes, hypotheses, or TODOs inline during debugging‚Äîannotations are saved and timestamped.
- **Session Resumption**: Resume any previous session, restoring context and state for seamless continuation.
- **Plugin Friendly & Lazy.nvim Compatible**: Written in Go with a Lua bridge, making it easy to integrate with any `lazy.nvim` setup.

## Architecture Overview

capytrace.nvim is a hybrid plugin, combining the power of Go for efficient event recording and exporting, with Lua for deep Neovim integration and user interaction.

- **Lua Frontend**: Handles Neovim events, user commands, and configuration. It communicates with the Go backend by invoking the compiled Go binary with appropriate arguments.
- **Go Backend**: Manages session state, records events, and exports session data to Markdown or JSON. It is responsible for efficient file I/O and data serialization.
- **Session Recording**: The plugin tracks a wide range of events, including file edits, terminal commands, cursor movements, file opens, and LSP diagnostics. Each event is timestamped and stored as part of the session timeline.
- **Exporters**: Sessions can be exported in Markdown (for human-friendly review) or JSON (for programmatic analysis or integration with other tools).

## How It Works

1. **Session Lifecycle**: Start a session with `:CapyTraceStart`. The plugin begins recording all relevant events. End the session with `:CapyTraceEnd` to export the timeline.
2. **Event Capture**: Lua autocommands hook into Neovim events (e.g., file edits, cursor moves, terminal opens) and call the Go binary to record each event.
3. **Annotations**: Add notes at any time with `:CapyTraceAnnotate`, which are saved as part of the session.
4. **Session Management**: List, resume, or check the status of sessions with dedicated commands.
5. **Export**: At session end, the Go backend exports the session timeline to Markdown or JSON, including a summary and all recorded events.

## Example Use Cases

- **Debugging**: Trace every step, command, and hypothesis during a complex bug hunt.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Export session logs to share with teammates or for onboarding documentation.
- **Context Switching**: Resume work exactly where you left off, even after a break or on a different machine.

## Installation & Requirements

- **Neovim**: v0.9.0 or higher
- **Go**: v1.18 or higher (required to build the backend binary)
- **Plugin Manager**: Easily integrates with `lazy.nvim` or other plugin managers.

---

## Getting Started

1. **Install** via your preferred plugin manager (see README for details).
2. **Build** the Go binary with `make build` (if not using prebuilt binaries).
3. **Configure** output format and save path in your Neovim config.
4. **Use** the provided commands to start, annotate, end, and resume sessions.
